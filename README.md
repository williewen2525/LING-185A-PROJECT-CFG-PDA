# Final-Proj
# Sentence Processing Simulation with Pushdown Automata

This project explores how different parsing strategies for context-free grammars (CFGs) model human sentence processing. Implemented in Haskell, three PDAs — top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner — simulate how center-embedded constructions affect stack size and reflect cognitive processing load.

## Features

- Implements three CFG-based parsers in Haskell
- Analyzes stack behavior on embedded sentences
- Links parsing difficulty to garden-path effects and human limitations
